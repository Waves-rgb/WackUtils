# WackUtils
![Build status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Waves-rgb/WackUtils.svg)

A collection of useful C++ functions & methods, I commonly use, so I don't need to re-implement them across projects.

# Features:
 - Ciphers
 - Encryption/Decryption
 - Hashing
 - Window & Process Manipulation
 - Encrypted Sockets (Wack Secure Sockets)

# Libraries in use:
  * [LibCURL](https://curl.se/libcurl/)
  * [Crypto++](https://cryptopp.com/)
  * [WackSecureSockets (Sub-library of WackUtils)](/include/WackUtils/wss/wss.h)

# To-do:
 - [ ] Implement Ciphers.
 - [ ] Implement Hashing.
 - [ ] Implement Networking.
 - [ ] Complete Encryption/Decryption.
 - [ ] Test cases for everything.
 - [ ] Write documentation. (Or find a generator)
